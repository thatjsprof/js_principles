// Introduction to js
/*
- JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform and object oriented computer programming language
- It is used both on the client side and server side
- It brings dynamic effects and interactivity
- There are a lot of js frameworks like vue, react, angular, jquery e.t.c 
*/



// Variables
/*
- Variables can be declared using the var, let and const keywords
- Primitive js types include:
    1. Number: Floats or ints
    2. Strings
    3. Boolean
    4. Undefined: declared but no value
    5. null: non-existent

- JavaScript has dynamic data typing: data types are automatically assigned to variables
- Don't use reserved keywords as variable names also don't start naming with numbers
- You can use camelCase notation to name variables

Examples:
    var teacher
    console.log(teacher) returns undefined

    teacher = 'james'
    console.log(teacher) returns james
*/



// Variable mutation and type coercion
/*
E.g
    var name = 'james'
    var age = 23
    console.log(name + ' ' + age) converts age to string

- Variable mutation just means that variable values can be changed so far they are not constants
*/



// Basic Operators
/*
- Math operators include the addition, subtraction, division and multiplication operators
- Logical operators are used for comparison
- Typeof operator returns the type of variable e.g typeof variable_name
- Operator precedence check developer.mozilla.org then type operator precedence
*/



// Conditionals
/*
- If/else statements
- The ternary operator ?
- Switch statements
*/



// Truthy, falsy values and equality operators
/*
- Falsy values: null, undefined, '', 0
- Truthy values: not falsy values
*/



// Functions
/*
- functions take arguments and are called
- function statements and expressions. expressions are assigned to a variable
